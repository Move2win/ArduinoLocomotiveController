# Arduino Locomotive Comtroller


#### This project is a type of upper computer software for the Arduino.


It is designed to send commands to an Arduino board (A) which is physically connected to a computer/laptop via a USB port.



The Arduino board (A) is worked as a wireless controller which sends wireless commands to an Arduino board (B). The Arduino board (B) works as a digital controller which pre-installed on a locomotive to control DC motors and other electronics.



**This repo only contains the code for the upper computer software.**

**Code for Arduino board (A) and (B) has not been published yet. (WIP)**

# Arduino Locomotive Controller


#### This project is a PC application for controlling the Arduino.


It is designed to send commands to an Arduino board (A) which is physically connected to a PC/laptop via a USB port.


The Arduino board (A) is worked as a wireless controller which sends radio communications to another Arduino board (B). The Arduino board (B) works as a digital controller which pre-installed on a locomotive to control DC motors and other electronics.
